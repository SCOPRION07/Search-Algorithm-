# Search-Algorithm
This project contains implementations of classic **graph search algorithms** in Java:

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **A\* (A-Star)  Algorithm**

These algorithms are fundamental in areas like artificial intelligence, game development, robotics, and graph theory.

**1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

Explores neighbors level by level.

Guarantees shortest path in unweighted graphs.

Uses a queue (FIFO).

**2. Depth-First Search (DFS)**

Explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking.

Uses a stack (LIFO) or recursion.

Can be used for cycle detection, topological sort, etc.

**3. A\* Search (A-Star)**

Heuristic-based pathfinding algorithm.

Combines cost-so-far and estimated cost to goal.

Guarantees optimal path if heuristic is admissible.
